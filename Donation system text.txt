Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Submitted by: Md. Shahriar Mehedi
Course: CSE 2100 - Software Development Project I
Supervisor: Md. Fahim Faisal

1. Project Overview
This project proposes the development of a Mosque Donation Management System that streamlines the process of collecting and managing donations for a single mosque. Visitors will be able to donate by scanning a QR code on-site, redirecting them to a web-based interface that supports bKash and Nagad, Bangladesh’s most popular mobile financial services.
An admin dashboard will allow mosque authorities to monitor, manage, and analyze donation data through a secure web interface.

2. Problem Statement
Traditional donation boxes offer no transparency or security and provide no structured audit trail. As digital payments become more common, especially among the younger generation, there's a growing need for a simple, secure, and accountable donation system.

3. Goals & Objectives
- Offer a mobile-friendly donation interface through QR code scanning
- Support seamless digital payment via bKash/Nagad
- Provide mosque admins with secure access to donation logs and analytics
- Build a lightweight system focused on a single mosque, with no user login required for donors



4. Key Features
Visitor (Donation Interface)
Scan QR code → Redirects to donation page
Enter donation amount (preset options + custom)
Redirect to payment method (sslCommerze)
Show confirmation page with basic transaction reference


Admin (Dashboard)
- Admin login with JWT + HttpOnly cookie authentication
- View donations list with filters (date, amount, payment method)
- See summary stats (daily, monthly, all-time total)
- Export donation history as CSV
- Update donation QR or account numbers (bKash/Nagad)
- Manage basic site info (mosque name, logo, banner)
- Post donation reason for each campaign (Reason for fund collection)
- Different types of donation campaigns will be there, visitors can choose one and pay
