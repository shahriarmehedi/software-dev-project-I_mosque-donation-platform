# Donation Platform Testing Guide

## Current System Status

‚úÖ **Fully Functional in Demo Mode**

- All donation flows work without requiring live payment credentials
- Graceful fallback when SSLCommerz credentials are missing
- Professional error handling and user feedback

## Quick Test Scenarios

### 1. **Test Donation Flow (Demo Mode)**

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/donate`
2. Fill out the donation form:
   - Select any campaign
   - Enter amount (e.g., 1000)
   - Choose any payment method
   - Fill optional donor information
3. Click "Donate Now"
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Demo payment notification appears
   - Redirected to success page with demo transaction ID
   - Yellow demo mode notice displayed

### 2. **Test Admin Dashboard**

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Login with:
   - Email: `admin@mosque.org`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. **Expected Result**: Access to admin dashboard with:
   - Donation statistics
   - Recent donations list
   - Campaign management
   - Settings panel

### 3. **Test Homepage Features**

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Expected Result**: Professional homepage with:
   - Hero section with mosque image
   - Featured campaigns with progress bars
   - Recent donations (with donor privacy)
   - Contact information
   - Responsive design

### 4. **Test Database Integration**

1. All data should persist between page refreshes
2. Donations should appear in admin dashboard
3. Campaign progress should update with new donations

## Payment Gateway Status

### Current State: **Demo Mode**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using placeholder SSLCommerz credentials
- All payment methods work in demo mode
- Demo transactions get transaction IDs like `DEMO_12345`

### To Enable Live Payments:

Update `.env.local` with real SSLCommerz credentials:

```env
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID=your_actual_store_id
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD=your_actual_store_password
SSLCOMMERZ_IS_LIVE=false  # Set to true for production
```

## Architecture Validation

### ‚úÖ Database Schema

- MongoDB Atlas connection working
- Prisma ORM properly configured
- All models seeded with sample data

### ‚úÖ API Routes

- `/api/donations/create` - Handles donation creation
- `/api/donations/[id]` - Fetches donation details
- `/api/payment/*` - Payment callback handlers
- `/api/auth/*` - Admin authentication

### ‚úÖ Frontend Components

- Responsive React components
- TypeScript type safety
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Loading states and error handling

### ‚úÖ Security Features

- JWT authentication for admin
- HttpOnly cookies
- Input validation
- Environment variable protection

## Production Readiness Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Project structure and dependencies
- [x] Database schema and seeding
- [x] Authentication system
- [x] Payment integration with fallback
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Responsive UI design
- [x] Admin dashboard functionality

### üîß Configure for Production

- [ ] Add real SSLCommerz credentials
- [ ] Update NEXTAUTH_URL for production domain
- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Add rate limiting for APIs
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## Key Features Working

1. **Multi-Campaign Support** - Different donation categories
2. **Flexible Payment Methods** - Card, mobile banking, net banking
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Full management interface
4. **Donor Privacy** - Anonymous and named donations
5. **QR Code Generation** - For easy mobile payments
6. **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
7. **Demo Mode** - Test without real payment processing

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** using the scenarios above
2. **Configure real payment credentials** when ready for live payments
3. **Deploy to production** (Vercel recommended for Next.js)
4. **Monitor and maintain** the system

## Troubleshooting

### If donations fail:

- Check console for error messages
- Verify database connection
- Ensure all environment variables are set

### If admin login fails:

- Verify seeded admin account exists
- Check JWT configuration
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### If styling issues occur:

- Run `npm run dev` to restart development server
- Check Tailwind CSS configuration
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## Support

The system is now fully functional and ready for testing. The demo mode allows you to test all features without requiring live payment credentials, making it perfect for development and staging environments.

When you're ready to go live, simply update the SSLCommerz credentials and the system will automatically switch to live payment processing.
