# Payment Status Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed

- Donations were staying in "PENDING" status after successful payment
- Campaign raised amounts were not being updated
- No progress tracking on homepage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated API Endpoint (`/api/donations/[id]`)

- Added PUT method to update donation status
- Automatically updates campaign `raisedAmount` when donation becomes COMPLETED
- Handles status changes in both directions (COMPLETED ↔ PENDING/FAILED)

### 2. Updated Success/Failure Pages

- **Success page**: Automatically updates donation to COMPLETED status
- **Failure page**: Automatically updates donation to FAILED status
- Both pages generate transaction IDs for successful payments

### 3. Enhanced Homepage

- Shows progress bars for each campaign
- Displays raised amount vs target amount
- Real-time percentage completion
- Uses dynamic colors from settings

### 4. Database Consistency

- Updated existing sample donations to COMPLETED status
- Recalculated all campaign raised amounts
- Added seed script logic to maintain consistency
